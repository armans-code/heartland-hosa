            "Hello Heartland! My name is Rayne Crenshaw, and I am honored to be serving as your Regional President this year. I am a senior in the International Baccalaureate program at Land O' Lakes High School. When not drowning in homework, I enjoy playing soccer, reading (currently What's Not to Love), and listening to music. My favorite artists are The Weeknd and Conan Gray! I recently completed an internship in the Integrated Mathematical Oncology department of Moffitt Cancer Center over the summer. I also regularly volunteer at Special Olympics events, started a mental health awareness organization called Speaking of Stigma, and co-founded the Medical Education Club at my school. During my last year on the board, I aim to share my knowledge and resources so all of you can gain more opportunities in the medical field. I can't wait to help you all find your passions through HOSA and make lifelong memories and connections like I have!",
